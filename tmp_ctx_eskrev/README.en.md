**Written here. Verifiable by anyone.**

.skr is an offline, portable, non-trackable editor built for human writing in the age of AI.

Texts exported as `.skr` include a technical record of the human writing process.

Text is produced exclusively through human typing.
The system records the writing process and generates a verifiable capsule (.skr).

## What is a .skr file

A `.skr` file contains:
- full text
- writing process metadata
- cryptographic hash
- verifiable technical evidence

It can be checked using **.skr Verify**.

## .skr Verify

.skr Verify checks whether a text corresponds to a real human writing process.

It is not AI detection.
It is not stylistic analysis.
It is technical verification.

## Philosophy

It provides technical evidence.

Interpretation remains human.
